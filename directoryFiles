# The purpose of my program is to have a user create a directory and then create a file #within that directory. The program will them store the user's name, address, and phone #number in that file. If a directory name already exists, they can add to the existing #files, or create a new file within that directory.

import os.path

path = os.curdir
print(path) # for debug
directory = str(input('Enter a name for your directory: ').strip()) #Prompting the user for directory
path = path + os.sep + directory
#print(path) # for debug
#print(os.path) # debug

  os.mkdir(path)
